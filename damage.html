<h1>Damage</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Attack &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Standard &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Close &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Instant &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 1 point per rank</span>
<p>You can inflict damage on a target by making a close attack. The exact nature of your Damage is
up to you, with the GM's approval; it can be anything from a powerful impact to razor claws, energy fields, or some
other damaging medium. The target resists with Toughness:</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DAMAGE-CHECK">Damage Check</h3>
<span class="generated-class-2">Toughness check vs. Damage power check</span>
<p><b>Success</b>: The damage has no effect.</p>
<p><b>Tie</b>: Instead of a tie being considered a "Success", the defender gets a bruised penalty.</p>
<p><b>Failure</b>: The target loses HP equal to the difference and gets a bruised penalty.</p>
<p>A bruised penalty imposes a -1 toughness penalty, is
a damage condition, and does not have any defense check (see Recovery in <a
href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-RECOVERY">Gameplay Rules</a>).
Bruised penalties are cumulative, so a target who fails 3 defense checks against Damage has a total -3 toughness
penalty.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-STRENGTH-AND-DAMAGE">Strength And Damage</h3>
<p>Strength provides a "built-in" Damage effect: the ability to hit things! This built-in damage
is named Unarmed. You can apply effect modifiers to the damage your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even an
Area effect! You can also have Alternate Effects for your Strength Damage; see the <b>Alternate Effect</b> modifier for
details. Like other Damage effects, a character's Strength Damage is close range and standard action by default.</p>
<p>Modifiers can't be applied to Unarmed Damage if your Strength is 0 or less. Any modifiers
applied to your Unarmed Damage changes the cost per rank of strength starting at the base 2 points per rank. Generally
every modifier on Unarmed damage must also be applied to any strength-based effect but if there is a conflict of
modifiers the Gamemaster decides how to handle it. The modifiers on strength-based effects, on the other hand, are
exclusive to that effect. See <b>Strength-Based</b> below for Damaging effects that are not Unarmed such as a melee
weapon.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DAMAGING-OBJECTS">Damaging Objects</h3>
<p>Objects take damage similar to characters except objects receive damage conditions directly instead of having HP
and use a different set of damage conditions. Constructs
(see <a href="../../constructs.html">Constructs</a>) are damaged as characters not objects.</p>
<p>Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and therefore subject to finishing attacks (see
the <b>Finishing Attack</b> maneuver in <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html">Gameplay Rules</a>):
essentially, you can choose between making your attack on the object as a routine
check or, if you make the attack check normally, gaining an automatic critical hit if your attack hits, for a +1 bonus
to effect.</p>
<p>Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a smash action (see the <b>Smash</b>
maneuver in <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html">Gameplay Rules</a>).</p>
<p>If an object is damaged it will either to bend, break or be destroyed depending on the
toughness check. If the object fails the Toughness check by only a single degree then it will bend or crack etc, two
degrees of failure on the Toughness check results in a break (such as a hole punched through the object) while three or
more degrees of failure means the object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.). An object that is bent will
still function (for the most part) until it is broken. An object that is destroyed can't be repaired by hand.</p>
<p>You may use damage to try to fix a bent object by bending it back to normal.
Otherwise these conditions are cumulative: if you are trying to break an object that is bent then 1 degree of success
will cause it to break. Against a broken object 1 degree of success will destroy it. Obviously objects won't
naturally recover unless the object has <a href="regeneration.html">Regeneration</a>.</p>
<p class="example"><b>Example</b>: Lady Justice, rescuing people from a tenement
fire, is hemmed-in by collapsed debris. Her player decides to simply punch a path through. Since she's going for maximum
damage, she decides to make the attack check normally (rather than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she'll only
miss on a natural -3 anyway. She succeeds and does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic critical. The GM decides the
brick, mortar, and heavy beams have Toughness 9 and makes a Toughness check, rolling a 1, against Lady Justice's
result of 15. A 5 result is three degrees of failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and clears the building,
carrying people to safety!</p>
<p>The Toughness ranks of some common materials are shown on the <b>Material Toughness</b> table. The
listed ranks are for about an inch and a half (distance rank -7) thickness of the material: apply a +1 Toughness bonus
per doubling of thickness or a -1 per halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment has Toughness based on
its material. Devices have a base Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided by 5 (rounded down, minimum
of 1).</p>

<h3 id="TOC-RECOVERY">Recovery</h3>
<p>Living subjects recover naturally over time or from the powers <a
href="healing.html">Healing</a> and <a href="regeneration.html">Regeneration</a>. For more detail see <a
href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-RECOVERY">Gameplay Rules: Recovery</a>.</p>
<p>Objects on the other hand do not naturally recover (normally) and must be repaired. See the
guidelines under the <b>Technology</b> skill when repairing damaged objects.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Affects Insubstantial</b>: An effect with this extra more aptly works on insubstantial
targets, in addition to having its normal effect on corporeal targets (while corporeal). If you are currently
insubstantial this modified power will not work on corporeal targets, for that you need <a href="../modifiers/extras.html#TOC-AFFECTS-CORPOREAL">Affects Corporeal</a>.
If the number
of Affects Insubstantial applications are equal to or greater than the number of ranks of the target's Insubstantial
power then your damaging effect works to full effect. Note that Fluid Insubstantial is not immune to any type of damage.
The asymmetry between Affects Corporeal and Affects Insubstantial is intentional. Although this modifier is intended for
damage it can also be applied to barriers so that Insubstantial can't pass through it. <b>Flat +1 per
application</b></p>
<p><b>Affects Objects</b>: This is included in damage and can't be applied again.</p>
<p><b>Incurable</b>: Effects such as <b>Healing</b> and <b>Regeneration</b> have a harder time
healing this Damage although natural recovery from stamina or by repair (for constructs and objects) can still recover
as normal. Effects with the <b>Persistent</b> extra can more aptly heal Incurable effects. If a character dies the
incurable restriction is removed so that they may be revived normally. <b>Flat +1 point per application</b></p>
<p><b>Unrecoverable</b>: This functions like the complement of Incurable in that effects with this
modifier can't be cured by natural recovery (stamina or repair) but all other forms of healing (Healing and
Regeneration) still work. Unrecoverable and Incurable can't both exist on the same effect for balance reasons. For an
effect that can't be cured by a specific descriptor use a limited version of Incurable. <b>+2 cost per rank</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FREE-MODIFIERS">Free Modifiers</h2>
<p><b>Strength-Based</b>: The Damage effect is Strength-based--something like a melee
weapon--allowing your Strength Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and Damage ranks together when determining the
rank of the attack. However, any decrease in your Strength reduces the amount you can add to your damage, and negative
Strength subtracts from your Damage! Likewise, anything that prevents you from exerting your Strength also stops you
from using a Strength-based Damage effect. If you can't swing your fist, you can't swing a sword, either. On the other
hand, a laser blade or thuderbolt staff does the same damage whether you can exert your Strength with it or not.</p>
<p><b>Non-Lethal</b>: If damage with this modifier would reduce HP from a non-negative number (0 or more)
to -1 or less, instead the target has -1 HP and is stabilized.
This modifier has no effect on the damage done to objects or to characters that already have -1 HP or less.
If you want to be able to choose between lethal and non-lethal damage take the other as an alternate effect.</p>
