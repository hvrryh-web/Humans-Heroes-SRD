<h1>Defenses</h1>
<p>Heroes face many hazards in their line of work, from attacks by villainous foes to traps and
fiendish mind control. A hero's <b>defenses</b> are traits used to avoid such things, determining the difficulty to
affect a hero with an attack, or to make <b>defense</b> checks against them. Each <b>defense</b> is based on a particular <a href="abilities.html">ability</a>,
modified by the hero's <a href="advantages.html">advantages</a> and <a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a>.
For more on when <b>defenses</b> are used and what happens see <a href="../gameplay/index.html#TOC-DEFENSE">Gameplay Rules: Defense</a>.</p>
<p>Note that unlike <a href="abilities.html">ability</a> scores, nothing special happens if a <b>defense</b> drops to 0 or below.
<a href="#TOC-TOUGHNESS-RANK">Toughness</a> has no lower limit because there is no maximum limit to the number of
<a href="../gameplay/conditions.html#TOC-DAMAGE-CONDITIONS">bruised penalties</a>.
However all other <b>defenses</b> have an effective minimum based on the maximum possible <a href="powers/effects/weaken.html">Weaken</a>
rank which is determined by <a href="power-level.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">power level</a>. Although note that if the
matching <a href="abilities.html">ability</a>, except
<a href="abilities.html#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a>, is <a href="abilities.html#TOC-DEBILITATED-ABILITIES">debilitated</a>
then the <b>defense</b> will automatically fail.</p>
<p><b>Defenses</b> are also used to measure the ability to overcome certain effects, involving a
<b>defense check</b> which consists of <b>defense</b> total plus a dice roll against a
<a href="../gameplay/the-basics.html#TOC-DIFFICULTY-CLASS">difficulty class</a> or
<a href="../gameplay/the-basics.html#TOC-OPPOSED-CHECKS">opposed roll</a> as determined by the effect or hazard.
So you might make a <a href="#TOC-PARRY">Parry defense check</a> for your hero to avoid a sword thrust by a villain, for example, or a
<a href="#TOC-DODGE">Dodge defense check</a> to evade a trap just as it is triggered, and so on. This may be referred to by
abbreviation such as "<a href="#TOC-WILL">Will</a> check"
or by "resisting" such as "resisted by <a href="#TOC-FORTITUDE">Fortitude</a>".</p>
<h2 id="TOC-DEFENSE-RANK">Defense Rank</h2>
<p>Your base <b>defense</b> ranks are equal to your ranks in their associated <a href="abilities.html">abilities</a>. You can increase
your <b>defenses</b> (except <a href="#TOC-TOUGHNESS-RANK">toughness</a>) above the values granted by your <a href="abilities.html">ability</a>
ranks by spending character points: 1 character point grants you
an additional rank in a <b>defense</b>, up to the <a href="power-level.html#TOC-POWER-LEVEL-LIMITATIONS">limits imposed by power level</a>.</p>
<span class="generated-class-2">Defense Cost = 1 character points per +1 rank</span>
<h3 id="TOC-TOUGHNESS-RANK">Toughness Rank</h3>
<p>The exception is <a href="#TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</a>, which can only be increased above your base
<a href="abilities.html#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a> rank using
<a href="advantages.html">advantages</a> and <a href="powers/effects/index.html">powers</a>, not by direct spending
of character points. This reflects that greater-than-normal <a href="#TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</a> is
virtually always some sort of special ability. See <a href="advantages.html#TOC-DEFENSIVE-ROLL">Defensive Roll</a>,
<a href="powers/effects/protection.html">Protection</a>, and <a href="powers/effects/enhanced-trait.html">Enhanced Trait: Toughness</a>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-ACTIVE-DEFENSES">Active Defenses</h2>
<p><a href="#TOC-DODGE">Dodge</a> and <a href="#TOC-PARRY">Parry</a> <b>defenses</b> require a measure of action to be fully
effective. Limits on your
mobility, focus, and reaction time adversely affect them. The <a href="../gameplay/conditions.html">conditions</a>
<a href="../gameplay/conditions.html#TOC-BASIC-CONDITIONS">vulnerable and defenseless</a> affect your <b>active
defenses</b> (see <a href="../gameplay/conditions.html">Conditions</a> for description).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-DODGE">Dodge</h3>
<p><b>Dodge defense</b> is based on <a href="abilities.html#TOC-AGILITY-AGL-">Agility</a> rank. It includes reaction time, quickness, nimbleness, and
overall coordination, used to avoid ranged attacks or other hazards where reflexes and speed are important.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-PARRY">Parry</h3>
<p><b>Parry defense</b> is based on <a href="abilities.html#TOC-FIGHTING-FGT-">Fighting</a>. It is the ability to counter, duck, or otherwise evade a
foe's attempts to strike you in close combat through superior fighting ability. Note that Parry never provides a counter
attack for balance reasons.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-PASSIVE-DEFENSES">Passive Defenses</h2>
<p><b>Passive defenses</b> are always present (unlike <a href="#TOC-ACTIVE-DEFENSES">active defenses</a>) even while unaware or incapacitated.
<b>Passive defense</b> are unaffected by the <a href="../gameplay/conditions.html">conditions</a>
<a href="../gameplay/conditions.html#TOC-BASIC-CONDITIONS">vulnerable and defenseless</a> and thus are always available.
The applicable <a href="#TOC-ACTIVE-DEFENSES">active defense</a> (if any) is rolled then the applicable <b>passive defense</b>
is rolled and thus most attacks must overcome two <b>defenses</b>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-WILL">Will</h3>
<p><b>Will defense</b> is based on <a href="abilities.html#TOC-PRESENCE-PRE-">Presence</a> rank. It measures mental stability, level-headedness,
determination, self-confidence, self-awareness, and willpower, used to resist mental or spiritual attacks.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-FORTITUDE">Fortitude</h3>
<p><b>Fortitude defense</b> is based on <a href="abilities.html#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a> and measures health and resistance to threats like poison
or disease. It incorporates constitution, ruggedness, metabolism, and immunity.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-TOUGHNESS">Toughness</h3>
<p><b>Toughness defense</b> is based on <a href="abilities.html#TOC-STAMINA-STA-">Stamina</a> and is resistance to direct damage or harm, and overall
durability.</p>
