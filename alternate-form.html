<h1>Alternate Form</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Effect</b>: Varies, Activation &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: effects total -1 or 2 points</span>
<p>You can transform into something other than mere flesh and blood, from a body of organic steel
to a cloud of gas, a mass of liquid, a swarm of tiny insect-sized robots, or anything else you want to develop. Choose a
set of effects that reflect the capabilities of your Alternate Form, based on the examples following. Then choose the
action required to assume your Alternate Form: if it requires a move action, subtract 1 character point from the total
cost of the effects. If it requires a standard action, subtract 2 points. See the <b>Activation</b> flaw for
details.</p>
<p>Some potential Alternate Forms (and their possible effects) include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Energy</b>: You are made up of energy, such as fire or electricity: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>
   (close or ranged), <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/flight.html">Flight</a>, <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunity</a>,
   <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> 3, and <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/teleport.html">Teleport</a> (Energy Medium).</li>
<li><b>Gaseous</b>: You are a cloud of gas, like fog or mist: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/affliction.html">Affliction</a> (Suffocate),
<a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/concealment.html">Concealment</a> (Visual, Attack), <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/flight.html">Flight</a>,
   <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunity</a>, and <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> 2.</li>
<li><b>Ghost</b>: You are incorporeal and invisible, largely unaffected by the physical world: <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/concealment.html">Concealment</a>
   (Visual), <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/flight.html">Flight</a>, <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunity</a>, and
   <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> 4.</li>
<li><b>Heroic</b>: You have a distinct "hero" form, in addition to your "normal" form. Essentially, all your powers have the
   Activation modifier! The inability to assume your heroic form might also constitute a complication for you from time to time.</li>
<li><b>Liquid</b>: You are made up of liquid (such as water): <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/affliction.html">Affliction</a> (Suffocate),
   <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/concealment.html">Concealment</a> (Visual, Limited to Underwater), Elongation, <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunity</a>,

   4, and <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/movement.html">Movement</a> (Slithering, Wall-crawling).</li>

   <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunity</a>, and Protection.</li>
<li><b>Swarm</b>: Your "body" is actually thousands of other tiny creatures: insects, worms, even little robots:
   <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/flight.html">Flight</a>, <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunity</a>, <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a>
