<h1>Constructs</h1>
<p>Armored robots, humanlike androids, even magically-animated golems or zombies are all examples
of <b>constructs</b>, non-biological things capable of acting on their own to one degree or another, carrying out direct
commands or preprogrammed instructions, or even possessing independent thought in some cases.</p>
<p>Constructs are more than devices or equipment since they are capable of action on their own
(rather than just improving their owner's abilities), constructs are considered characters. You may acquire a construct
as a <a href="advantages.html#TOC-MINION">Minion</a>, <a href="advantages.html#TOC-SIDEKICK">Sidekick</a>,
or via <a href="powers/effects/summon-minion.html">Summon Minion</a>. Upon character creation you may also decide to be a
construct since there are some thematic differences from other characters as explained below.</p>
<p>For some examples of constructs see <a href="../examples/characters/constructs/index.html">Example Constructs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-CONSTRUCT-CREATION">Construct Creation</h2>
<p>Since constructs are characters they are created exactly like other characters, using the guidelines in <a
href="index.html">Character Creation</a> and are limited as normal by their own power level (which will
be lower than your's in the case of a <a href="advantages.html#TOC-MINION">Minion</a> or <a href="advantages.html#TOC-SIDEKICK">Sidekick</a>).
The rules listed on this page are simply things to note to fit the theme and are not required.</p>
<p>The term "construct" refers to a character that is not biological. By game terms they are considering "living" or "dead"
as normal (based on HP) even if role-playing wise a robot or zombie would not be referred to as "alive" in the normal sense.
Most constructs therefore have the <a href="complications.html">complication</a> <b>No Natural
Healing</b> although this is not required to be considered a construct.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-POWERS">Powers</h3>
<p>Power effects are often aspects of a construct's makeup or design, such as built-in armor
(<a href="powers/effects/protection.html">Protection</a>), weapons (<a href="powers/effects/damage.html">Damage</a>),
or sensors (<a href="powers/effects/senses.html">Sense</a>).</p>
<p>Constructs often have <a
href="powers/effects/immunity.html">Immunities</a> most notably <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity
to fatigue</a> (30 points) in order to continue performing a task indefinitely without tiring, <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-LIFE-SUPPORT">life
support</a> (6 points), <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-SENSORY-EFFECTS">Immunity to sensory effects</a> (5 points),
and <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-AGE">Immunity to natural aging</a> (1 point).
Constructs might lack certain <a href="powers/effects/senses.html">senses</a> in the form of
<a href="complications.html">complications</a>, and may have
<a href="powers/effects/resistance.html">resistances</a> to certain things.</p>
<p>Due to <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html">immunity</a> from effects being unbalanced and the fact that all character start out
as human and must buy (or sell) the differences, constructs have many unexpected similarities to humans. Constructs by
default are actually more like prosthetics in that they have a similar internal structure so that they are weak to the
same poisons and diseases (I know it sucks but that's the best explanation I got). It is possible for a disease or
poison to take <a href="powers/modifiers/flaws.html#TOC-LIMITED">limited to non-constructs only</a> (assuming that
is worth a point). Fortitude for constructs may instead be
in the form of an anti-virus program, the requirement for eating may be in the form of requiring a battery recharge, the
need for sleep may be in the form of disk formatting (<a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-STARVATION-AND-THIRST">immunities
for food</a> and <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-SLEEP">sleep</a> exist). Fatigue effects might be
overheating or low battery for those who recharge automatically (without eating) going into a power saving mode either
way (<a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity to fatigue</a> exists). Of course
looking at a zombie or similar construct makes much more sense for the similarities to humans.</p>
<p>Constructs may be built larger or smaller than a human in which case buy <a href="powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-INNATE">Innate</a>
<a href="powers/modifiers/extras.html#TOC-INCREASED-DURATION">Permanent</a> <a href="powers/effects/growth.html">Growth</a>
or <a href="powers/effects/shrinking.html">Shrinking</a>.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-ABILITIES">Abilities</h3>
<p>Constructs often have &infin; Stamina via <a href="powers/effects/immunity.html#TOC-FATIGUE">Immunity
to fatigue</a> (30 points). If the construct is not a player character then it is possible to be absent certain <a href="abilities.html">abilities</a>
(and thus have -&infin; for those).</p>
<p>If you would like to have a construct without free will then it can be lacking Presence (for 10 points back) however this
is not allowed for player characters. Note that this causes the construct to be without loyalty and will obey anyone who
asks. For the opposite effect note that <a href="advantages.html#TOC-MINION">Minions</a> and <a href="advantages.html#TOC-SIDEKICK">Sidekicks</a>
are loyal to you by default. If you would like your construct to only obey you but act as though it had no free will that
is done via role-playing (and <a href="complications.html">complications</a> but don't remove Presence).</p>
