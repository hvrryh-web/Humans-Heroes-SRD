<h2 id="TOC-GROUND-VEHICLES">Ground Vehicles</h2>
<p>Most cars include such standard features as air conditioning, air bags, antilock brakes, cruise
control, keyless entry, and an AM/FM radio with CD player. Luxury vehicles often also include extras such as power
seats, leather upholstery, and a sunroof.</p>
<p><b>Cars</b> come in many different varieties. For variations on the base model, add +1 or +2
Str for larger, full-sized, cars, and +1 or even +2 Speed for sports and racing cars.</p>
<p><b>Trucks</b> include pick-ups, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), vans, and similarly sized
vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Tanks</b> are heavily armed and armored vehicles. The standard tank has Impervious Toughness
12 and comes equipped with a cannon (Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area 6) and a heavy machine gun (Ranged Multiattack Damage
6). It takes a move action to get into or out of a tank, and another move action to start it up.</p>
<p><b>APCs</b> or Armored Personnel Carriers, are designed for carrying troops. They come with a
smaller cannon (Ranged Damage 6, Burst Area 4), Impervious Toughness 8, and are set up so soldiers on board can fire
their personal weapons from behind the cover of the APC's armor.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-WATER-VEHICLES">Water Vehicles</h2>
<p>Water vehicles range from small boats and outboards to massive sea-going ships.</p>
<p><b>Cutters</b> are used by the Coast Guard and the Navy. They're often equipped with light
machine guns (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6).</p>
<p><b>Destroyers</b> are main naval ships, carrying heavy guns (Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area
8).</p>
<p><b>Battleships</b> have massive gun batteries (Ranged Damage 13, Burst Area 9) and heavy
armor.</p>
<p><b>Submarines</b> are equipped with torpedoes (Ranged damage 8, Burst Area 5) and often
ballistic missiles (Ranged Burst Area Damage 15 or higher, not included in listed cost).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-AIR-VEHICLES">Air Vehicles</h2>
<p>Air vehicles are all capable of flight, some of them at very high speeds.</p>
<p><b>Military helicopters</b> are equipped with machine guns (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6) and
rockets (Ranged Damage 9, Burst Area 6).</p>
<p><b>Fighter jets</b> have machine guns (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6) and air-to-air missiles
(Ranged Damage 11, Burst Area 8, Homing 6).</p>
<p><b>Bombers</b> may have machine guns and missiles, but also have powerful bombs (Burst Area
Damage 12 or higher) they can drop on targets.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SPACE-VEHICLES">Space Vehicles</h2>
<p>Space vehicles are intended for use outside the atmosphere, some of them for interplanetary or
even interstellar travel. Generally space vehicles are found in the possession of alien civilizations, although the GM
may choose to allow some organizations and individuals on Earth to have space vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Space fighters</b> are armed with blaster cannons (Ranged Damage 10).</p>
<p><b>Space cruisers</b> have larger beam weapons (Ranged damage 12) and often energy torpedoes
(Ranged Damage 12, Burst Area 10, Homing 8).</p>
<p><b>Space battleships</b> have the most massive weapons: blaster cannons (Ranged Damage 15) and
high-powered energy torpedoes (Ranged Damage 15, Burst Area 12, Homing 8).</p>
<h2 id="TOC-SPECIAL-VEHICLES">Special Vehicles</h2>
<p>These are unique vehicles, most likely found in the possession of supervillains, aliens, or
eccentric inventors.</p>
<p><b>Dimension hopper</b> is a van sized vehicle capable of moving between dimensions like a rank
3 Movement (Dimensional Travel) effect.</p>
<p><b>Mole-machines</b> are classic weapons for underground villains, consisting of a metallic
cylinder with treads and a rotating drill mounted on the front, allowing the machine to bore through the earth. Its
speed is a <a href="../../character-creation/powers/effects/permeate.html">Permeate effect</a>.</p>
<p><b>Time machines</b> may be enclosed vehicles, from cubes to spheres or even pods on legs or
police boxes, or they can simply be open platforms or projectors. They provide a Movement (Time Travel) effect,
typically rank 2 or 3, although some time machines may transmit only to a fixed point in time.</p>
