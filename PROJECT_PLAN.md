# Project Plan

## Goals
- Keep the static SRD pages easy to browse locally.
- Preserve and expand the in-browser automated tests.
- Reduce friction for future contributors by capturing next steps.

## Completed in this update
- Documented a quick-start workflow for serving the site locally.
- Captured how to run the existing in-browser test suite from `point-counter.html`.

## Upcoming improvements
- Add a minimal script (for example, an npm or Python helper) to start a local server with sensible defaults.
- Automate the browser-based tests with a headless runner so they can be executed in CI.
- Tackle TODOs called out in the codebase (e.g., the `updateOffense` ranged skill requirement) and add regression coverage.
- Expand contributor guidance with coding standards and directory conventions as they solidify.
