<h1>Concealment</h1>
<span class="info-banner"><b>Type</b>: Sensory &#8226; <b>Action</b>: Free &#8226; <b>Range</b>: Personal &#8226; <b>Duration</b>: Sustained &#8226; <b>Cost</b>: 2-8 points per rank</span>
<p>You gain total concealment from a particular sense while this effect is active, although you
are still detectable to other senses (even other senses of the same sense type; so you could have total concealment
against normal sight, but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense type). Each additional rank does nothing
and is only intended to raise the difficulty for <a href="nullify.html">Nullify</a> and
<a href="senses.html#TOC-COUNTERS-CONCEALMENT">Senses that Counters Concealment</a>. See total
<a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-CONCEALMENT">Concealment</a>
for full effects. Concealment costs 2 points per rank for concealment from a
single sense except visual (Auditory, Olfactory, Radio, Mental) and costs 4 points per rank for concealment from the
entire sense type. Concealment from visual senses cost 4 points per rank for one visual sense or 8 points per rank
for all visual senses.
</p>
<p>You cannot have concealment from tactile senses, since that requires being incorporeal (see <a
href="insubstantial.html">Insubstantial</a> effect). You cannot have concealment from all Special senses, since
the group is a catch all for exotic senses you can only take concealment from them individually.
</p>
<h3 id="TOC-CONCEALMENT-AND-PERCEPTION-RANGE">Concealment And Perception Range</h3>
<p>Perception range effects must accurately perceive a target in order to affect it. This
generally means you cannot target subjects with total concealment from your accurate senses with perception range
effects. Thus, foes with Visual Concealment (the most common accurate sense) can be quite effective against characters
relying on perception range attacks, unless the attacker has an unusual accurate sense to circumvent the Concealment.
This is one reason Visual Concealment costs extra.</p>
<p>At the Gamemaster's discretion, a successful Perception check to accurately locate a target
with an acute sense may allow you to use perception range effects on that target; however, the target still benefits
from total <a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-CONCEALMENT">Concealment</a>, granting a +2 circumstance
bonus to defend against the effect.</p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-EXTRAS">Extras</h2>
<p><b>Affects Others</b>: This modifier allows you to grant Concealment to others while you are
touching them, or at range, if you also apply the Range modifier. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Area</b>: Concealment with Affects Others (previously) or attack (immediately following) may
have this extra, affecting everything in the area. To only affect some targets in the area, apply the Selective modifier
as well. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Attack</b>: Use this extra for a Concealment effect you can impose on others (whether they
want to be concealed or not). An invisibility ray, for example, is a Visual Concealment Attack, while a field of
darkness is a Burst Area Visual Concealment Attack. <b>+1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Precise</b>: You can vary your Concealment as a free action: going from total to
partial to no concealment, concealing some parts and not others, or anywhere in-between. If your Concealment affects
multiple senses, you can also choose to affect some of those senses and not others. Concealment is normally
all-or-nothing: either you are concealed to the full amount of your effect, or you're not. <b>Flat +1 point.</b></p>
<h2 class="power-modifier-header" id="TOC-FLAWS">Flaws</h2>
<p><b>Blending</b>: You "blend" into the background. Your Concealment only functions as long as
you move no faster than your (ground speed rank -1), since your blending can't adapt faster than that. <b>-1 cost per
rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Limited</b>: Your Concealment only works under certain conditions, such as in fog, shadows,
or in urban locales. One example is Limited to Machines, where your Concealment only fools senses with a technological
descriptor. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Partial</b>: Your effect provides partial rather than total concealment (see
<a href="../../../gameplay/index.html#TOC-CONCEALMENT">Concealment</a>). <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Passive</b>: Your Concealment only lasts until you do something requiring an attack or power
check on your part, at which point it stops working until you reactivate it, which you may do on the following round.
<b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
<p><b>Resistible</b>: Your Concealment offers a defense check (chose a defense when the flaw is
applied) for anyone aware of your presence and actively looking for you. Concealment Resistible by Will may represent
some sort of mental illusion effect. <b>-1 cost per rank.</b></p>
